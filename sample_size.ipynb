    "# Problem\n",
    "You work for a music streaming company that specializes in using machine learning to recommend new music. As a data scientist on the team, you helped develop a new recommendation algorithm to improve user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm introduces a new stage in the processing pipeline, leveraging unsupervised learning to cluster users based on their listening history and the instrumentals present in the tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal testing showed promising results in how these clusters relate to music recommendations, but now it's time for a real-world evaluation. You need to design an experiment to compare the effectiveness of this new algorithm with the existing recommendation system.\n",
    "# Sample Size Calculator\n",
    "This sample size calculator allows you to generate the number of samples needed for each side of an A/B test.\n",
